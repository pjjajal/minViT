# minViT
A minimal ViT implementation in PyTorch. 
The implementation is "largely" self-contained with some minimal use of [timm](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models). 
Most of the core modules have been implemented in a simple way and should provide hackable, and transparent implementation â€” albeit less configurable than timm.

This is made for simple copy-paste use, or as a *starting point* for any model design or experimentation.
